# Node ts starter app

Welcome to a simple starter project using node.js! Here we have
* TypeScript, shared logic between client and server
* Sass, Postcss, Autoprefixer
* Webpack configured for client bundles
* Pug templates

We DO NOT have:
* Static site generation (but you can easily add your own)
* Frontend frameworks (but you can easily add one)
* A lot of abstractions(you can add any)
